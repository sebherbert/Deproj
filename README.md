# DeProj HOW TO

## Launch the program
The method can both be called in a GUI and by the command line of MATLAB
1. To call the method using the GUI:

 start the DeProj_GUI app in MATLAB `>> DeProj_GUI`. The GUI will guide you to provide the proper inputs and outputs to the method as well as the method parameters. The app has been created under MATLAB R2017b version and using an older version may create unexpected behavior.
 
2. To call the method using the command line: enter `>> surface3D_combine()`

 * In case all arguments are provided, the method will continue with the desired inputs
 * In case no arguments are provided, the method will revert to default parameters and only ask the user for inputs and output paths.
