function [ f3d, v ] = fit_ellipse_3d( p, E, method )
%FIT_ELLIPSE_3D Fit a 2D ellipse to a set of 3D points.
%   The fit requires (or compute) the Euler angles of the plane fitted
%   through the opints, so that we can project them on this plane. We then
%   make a 2D ellipse fit on the projected points. This turns to be much
%   more robust than a 3D fit, and also closely match our configuration.
%
%   This function returns f3d = [ x0 y0 z0 a b theta ]. These are the
%   cartesian parameters of the ellipse in the rotated plane. The ellipse
%   semi-major axis and semi-minor axis are always so that a >= b and theta
%   measure the angle of the semi-major axis with respect to the X axis (in
%   the rotated plane).
%
%   v is the transformation matrix that rotates the 3D points close to the
%   XY plane. It will be used to plot the ellipse in 3D.
